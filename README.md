# Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike website. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Instructions

- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomenas.

- Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). 

- Use your visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

- Create the a map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
The map should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during the analysis.

- Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
