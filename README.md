# Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike website. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Instructions

- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomenas.

- Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). 

- Use your visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

- Create the a map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
The map should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during the analysis.

- Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

# Results














Citi Bike offers the nation’s largest bike share program across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City and Hoboken providing membership and non-membership options while catering to longtime locals or people just visiting the town. Citi Bikes supplies riders with the choice between a classic bike or electric bike which can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station, giving convenience to any type of rider. 


Among the total number of riders in March 2024, membership riders took the greatest share at 95.4%, indicating local riders are the main users of the program. The data further suggests local riders are utilizing the program to commute to and from work during the week, as the peak hour usage is 7am - 8am and 5pm - 6pm Monday through Friday. There is a substantial amount of member ridership on Sunday as well, falling into the second highest ridership day with Friday being the most popular.


Comparing the top ending and starting stations there are more people coming into the city. Though not the same, the popularity of location between start and end stations areas are similar as they are both generally below the Midtown Manhattan region.  Overall, the data observed points to a couple target audiences who mainly utilize the Citi Bike program.  The first audience are the people living in the New York area using electric bikes to commute into the city for work. The second group also prefers the electric bike; however, these New Yorker's are taking advantage of the program during the day on Sundays to go into the city. Observing more data over a longer period of time would provide a statistically conclusive result.
